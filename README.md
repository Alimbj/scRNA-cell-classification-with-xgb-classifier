# scRNA-cell-classification-with-xgb-classifier
This project focuses on classifying brain cell types using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The primary objective is to build a machine learning model, specifically using XGBoost, to accurately identify cell types based on gene expression data.
